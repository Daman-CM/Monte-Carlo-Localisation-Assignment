# Monte Carlo Localisation Assignment
The objective of this assignment was implementing the main elements of the Monte Carlo Localisation algorithm covered.
This repository applies the MCL algorithm for localisation a virtual 3-DoF robot in a simple simulated environment consisting
of a set point-based landmark.
